# Tea on Three
*Last Amended: 8/22/2016 by Audrey Lewis, Czar of Communication and Finance
## Purpose
Tea on Three's purpose is to hold a weekly tea party in West Hall to bring together Olin students. What sets our social hour apart from others is that it's made to be quieter, more accessible, at a time of day when people are normally working and need a relaxing break.

## Membership
Tea on Three is designed to be open to whomever shows up, but "official" members will be those on the club mailing list.

## Officers and Roles
Tea on Three will always have someone who sends out emails, and someone who buys the tea and other supplies. A Czar of Communication and a Czar of Finance, if you will. They can be the same person.

## Transition Protocol
If there is a volunteer to take over one of the Czar positions and the current Czar would like to abdicate, they may do so at anytime. When a Czar graduates or takes a LOA, they must designate a replacement.

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space
The club is expected to maintain a stash of cheap, common teas and cookies. Other materials like fancy loose leaf teas, hot water kettles, and mugs will be volunteered by members. The club-purchased supplies will live in the Czar of Finance's room, since they will be the one buying them. This shouldn't be a problem because Honor Code.

## Events and Activities
Tea on Three will mainly hold the weekly tea parties. They may collaborate with other clubs, like Breakfast and NPR, to provide tea for their events. They may also hold occasional and strategic relaxing tea events during stressful times like finals.

## Amendment Procedure
The charter may be amended at any tea party by majority vote, as long as both Czars are there.
